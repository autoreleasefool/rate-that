# Rate That

A React Native app built to help you easily rate anything, keeping track of what you love and what you don't.

Start by creating notebooks for each category of items you'd like to rate, then add ratings as you need. You'll be able to see a summary of your ratings, and even filter the ratings, for stats on a subset of the ratings.

For movies, you'll be able to take advantage of [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org) to search for the movie and get some additional info, and its poster.
